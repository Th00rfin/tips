navigate - Navigate to the nearest route in the navigation state. navigate only pushes a new screen if the new route is different (not including search parameters or the hash). Otherwise, the current screen rerenders with the new parameters. If you navigate to a route that is in the history, the stack will dismiss screens to that route.
push - Always pushes a new route, and never pops or replaces to existing routes. You can push the current route multiple times or with new parameters.
replace	- Remove the current route from the history and replace it with the specified URL. This is useful for redirect
- you can use this in an inside a function such that
const fun = ()=>{
router.push("/")
}
