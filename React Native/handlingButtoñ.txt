Displaying a basic button
Button provides a basic button component that is rendered nicely on all platforms. The minimal example to display a button looks like this:

Touchables
Generally, you can use TouchableHighlight anywhere you would use a button or link on web. The view's background will be darkened when the user presses down on the button.

You may consider using TouchableNativeFeedback on Android to display ink surface reaction ripples that respond to the user's touch.

TouchableOpacity can be used to provide feedback by reducing the opacity of the button, allowing the background to be seen through while the user is pressing down.

If you need to handle a tap gesture but you don't want any feedback to be displayed, use TouchableWithoutFeedback
