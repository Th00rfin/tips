NavigationContainer
Now, you need to wrap the whole app in NavigationContainer. Usually you'd do this in your entry file, such as index.js or App.js:

Usage:
import * as React from 'react';
import {NavigationContainer} from '@react-navigation/native';
import {createNativeStackNavigator} from '@react-navigation/native-stack';

const Stack = createNativeStackNavigator();

const MyStack = () => {
  return (
    <NavigationContainer>
      <Stack.Navigator>
        <Stack.Screen
          name="Home"
          component={HomeScreen}
          options={{title: 'Welcome'}}
        />
        <Stack.Screen name="Profile" component={ProfileScreen} />
      </Stack.Navigator>
    </NavigationContainer>
  );
};
- ung home dyan may folder pa yan so pedeng meron pa ung home menu gann ganun
In this example, there are 2 screens (Home and Profile) defined using the Stack.Screen component. Similarly, you can define as many screens as you like.

You can set options such as the screen title for each screen in the options prop of Stack.Screen.
