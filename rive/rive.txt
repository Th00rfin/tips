note for rive. a web app that focus on transforming prototype to actually code.

: the thing is that rive and figma is little bit similar but it focus on animation.

there's a artboard where you can store your object and animatte, just like a frame in the figma. but the artboard has a design and animation, just like figma_ design and prototypeing.

so in rive thers a time or frame where you can move in that secs oor frame per secs to animate it. 

you can edit the vertices by clicking the object and finding the path and you can edit it.
