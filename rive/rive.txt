note for rive. a web app that focus on transforming prototype to actually code.

: the thing is that rive and figma is little bit similar but it focus on animation.

there's a artboard where you can store your object and animatte, just like a frame in the figma. but the artboard has a design and animation, just like figma_ design and prototypeing.

so in rive thers a time or frame where you can move in that secs oor frame per secs to animate it. 

you can edit the vertices by clicking the object and finding the path and you can edit it.

so in anmation theres timeline and the state machine. the state machie is the initial object or the frame while the timeline dun ung lalagay pano magrrun or how it will be animate anmdd you can also put a duration how many secs it will be animated. - doeas thing you can the speed.

pedeng mong ibaba or pabagalin ing animation with the interpolation depende sayo if naka default sya or customize depende sa travel nung bola kapag linear meaning tuloy tuloy lang walang bigat or something bouncy. ma aanimate mo zya with the drive next key, and then jt depends on you how controlled it with the x and y coordinate.

also you can add input and controlled para ma control mo ing animation 

meron ding workstation sa tabi nung mga looping, sa workstation is dun nakalagay kung hanggang saan lang ung loop, kasi may parang black yon.
and also ung sa design, whch is ung bone. you can animate that bone.

motion path this the path where the animation will it take, you can find this in the parents of a element.

also in order to aniamte you need keys from the ast key to the 2nd key it dpened how many frames it will take, the more the frames is higher the slower it takes

notes also you can group them by just dragging it to what you want group or element
