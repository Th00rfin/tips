implementation for voice analysis
   creating model and training model

* convert raw audio data into suitable format for model
* Extract ung audio data like ung picth, tone, intensity
* gagamit model archicture 
  ex: 
  - simple LSTM( long short-term memory) network
  - CNNS
  - RNNs
  - Hybrid model


# load your dataset from the file or yung nacollect the data from tamang voice
   - need ko kuha file supported by audio 

# preprocess and extarct features dun sa file

# create model
# compile model
# train model



* train the model on labeled dataset
